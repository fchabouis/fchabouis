Hello!

I'm a freelance developer based in Bordeaux, France, specializing in Elixir, Python and JavaScript. I enjoy working with PostgreSQL/PostGIS and building robust, scalable applications.

For the past few years, Iâ€™ve been working with [beta.gouv.fr]([url](https://beta.gouv.fr/)), the French governmentâ€™s incubator for innovative public services. I started by developing a [tool]([url](https://github.com/CartAV/cartav)) for visualizing road accident data in France, then spent three years working on [transport open-data](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/). Currently, Iâ€™m contributing to the [RÃ©fÃ©rentiel National des BÃ¢timents (RNB)](https://rnb.beta.gouv.fr/), striving to create a unique and permanent identifier for every building in the country.

On the side, I maintain [parc-epique.fr](parc-epique.fr), a website dedicated to kids' playgrounds. I also provide [an alternative server](https://github.com/fchabouis/applause_button_elixir_server) for applause-button.com, a project built with Elixir.
